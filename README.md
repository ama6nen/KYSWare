# KYSWare
Old CSGO cheat from 2017-2018. Based on CSGOSimple. Mostly my own code, has some pasted parts though.
It also contains the standalone menu source which runs as its own app that I used to develop it.
This is 100% outdated by now, and its full of ghetto debug shit.
Has some cool things tho like had lby exploit to break lby at any angle, multicolor chams, custom models, my own kysware ak model, some other features which arent found in your usual cheats most of the time.
Its mostly focused around misc and visual features as i was the most interested in making them, its useless for hvh or legit, other than the aa. It wont run even if you update it to the newest csgo version as it uses models i had hardcoded because this was meant for my own use mainly.
